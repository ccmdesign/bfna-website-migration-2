      "excerpt": "Just a day after Donald Trump’s decisive U.S. presidential win, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz ushered in the end of his own government with the firing of his finance minister and coalition partner, Christian Lindner. Lindner, representing the pro-business Free Democratic Party (FDP), objected strongly to a 2025 draft budget in which the other coalition members, Scholz’s center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the Greens, increased social spending. The FDP’s insistence on adhering to Germany’s debt brake, a constitutional provision that limits annual structural deficits to 0.35% of GDP, created friction among the three coalition partners in the wake of a 2023 constitutional court ruling that prohibited unused COVID-19 relief funds from financing other projects. The decision blew a $65 billion hole in the budget for 2024. But the final straw for the deeply unpopular coalition was a leaked policy paper in which Lindner outlined tax cuts and spending reductions, both of which negated a coalition agreement reached only a few weeks earlier. Subsequent revelations from an internal FDP document, controversially entitled “D-Day Scenarios and Measures”, showed the party had been planning to undermine the government in which it played a key role.",

      "excerpt": "In November 2023, Germany’s Constitutional Court ruled that €60 billion in special funds originally designated for Covid-19 relief could not be redirected to the governing coalition’s landmark climate and transformation fund. This left an estimated €17 billion hole in Germany’s tightly regulated balance sheet, forcing the already unpopular coalition to make cuts to the 2024 federal budget. Two of the cost-saving proposals to fill that gap were an end to subsidies for agricultural diesel and elimination of tax exemptions for farm vehicles. The pushback from German farmers was swift, with demonstrations of angry famers popping up around the country. After weeks of protests, including a near blockade by tractors in front of the Brandenburg Gate, the government agreed in early January to keep the tax exemption for farm vehicles and phase out the agricultural diesel subsides over the next three years, rather than eliminate them immediately. Ultimately, beyond securing these concessions, the farmers’ protests were in vain, as the walk back of agricultural diesel subsidies were included in the €477 billion federal budget for 2024 approved on February 2.",

      "excerpt": "In an interview with The Economist released November 7, French President Macron laid out a grand strategic vision for the EU. He called for the creation of an EU military, stronger technological sovereignty, and reforms to deepen the political unity of the EU instead of just growing the single market. Other European leaders immediately pushed back, especially against his strong critique of the purpose of NATO today. However, the timing—in the midst of a flurry of events that put Macron in the spotlight—gives his statements a particular potency, even if his ideas are controversial and somewhat contradictory. Macron chose his moment well, and the coming months will show if he can nudge the path of the EU to match his vision, or if Brussels will push back harder.",

Global events and developments, such as China’s integration into the world economy, the 2008 financial crisis, and the Eurozone crisis, have created, and in some cases, compounded longstanding trade and investment asymmetries around the world. These imbalances have no single cause, but are fostered and magnified by the competitiveness of a country’s industries, domestic demand, corporate investment decisions, and tax and monetary policy, among other factors. In recent years, the widening gaps in countries’ trade relationships have become highly politicized, prompting policymakers to respond with measures ranging from formalized monitoring to punitive tariffs.",

      "excerpt": "In its 2001 accession protocol to the World Trade Organization (WTO), China agreed to provisions that would allow other countries to treat it as a nonmarket economy for the purposes of certain trade disputes, leveling the playing field for companies that otherwise could not compete with China’s production capacity. A key element of those provisions expired in December 2016, and the Chinese government insists that its trading partners are now legally obligated to treat it as a market economy – a designation that would limit the tariffs that WTO members could levy on Chinese exports. The United States and European Union disagree with China’s claim, and maintain that – regardless of its interpretation of the accession protocol – China does not meet the standards required by U.S. and EU law for the designation of market economy status, and will not be treated as such until it does.",

The primary season always brings out party activists who tend to gravitate toward the more extreme edges of their respective camps, but the general election typically forces candidates to pivot to the center in search of those ever-elusive undecided or swing voters. This election campaign, however, has bucked decades of conventional wisdom.",

For the first time since negotiations began in 2013, senior European Commission and U.S. government officials have publicly acknowledged that TTIP will not be concluded before the end of U.S. President Barack Obama’s term. However, the United States and European Union remain committed to finalizing the agreement, and the parties now aim to advance negotiations as much as possible before the next U.S. president takes office in January 2017.",

They concern as much the disparity in military power—all 28 member states of the European Union together spend less on defense than the United States alone—as well as the very different historical experiences. Two devastating wars taught Europe to embrace reconciliation, cooperation and peaceful conflict resolution. The success of European integration, which led arch-enemies such as France and Germany to unite in a democratic and rules-based multilateral system, convinced Europeans to favor soft power over hard power. Likewise, the civilizing force of European integration made Europeans think of the EU as a role model for shaping a peaceful world order. In contrast, the United States as the world leader and in its own words “second to none” has overwhelmingly favored power politics and the maintenance of military superiority to secure peace and stability.",

      "excerpt": "The discussion surrounding surveillance and the collection of personal data—whether by the private or public sector—and the debate over the authority of the intelligence services have never been more relevant in Germany. The debate has become more complex and contentious as a result of the disclosures about U.S. surveillance by whistleblower Edward Snowden and the growing threat of terrorist attacks worldwide. Some politicians are using this heightened awareness to call for and sometimes push through tougher security laws, while others have rallied against what they perceive to be too much government surveillance. In the midst of this jockeying, pragmatic solutions offered by moderate players have often gone unnoticed. Although there are a variety of opinions on the subject, non-Germans are usually surprised by the strength of the opposition to surveillance measures in the country.",

The animals are to accompany Chinese President Xi Jinping when he visits Berlin next year, and will serve as goodwill ambassadors in the city’s zoo. Everyone loves pandas: They are cute, vulnerable, peaceful and vegan. Policymakers in Beijing would like nothing more than for the world to feel for China at large the kind of sympathy it affords the country’s national animal. “Panda diplomacy” has therefore long been a part of the country’s soft-power portfolio.",

Implicit in this policy, however, was the assumption that if a nation pivots toward something, it is simultaneously pivoting away from something else – Europe and the Middle East in this case. The reality is that foreign policy is not always a zero-sum game, and governments ought to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time.",

Negotiators tabled a record number of text proposals this round and made progress on important technical details related to market access, regulatory issues and trade rules. However, the parties remain deadlocked on several critical elements of the agreement, including market access for services, government procurement and investment protection. U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman and EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmström met again in Brussels earlier this week for a post-round stocktaking. They maintain their stated goal of reaching at least a political agreement – a nearly complete, agreed-upon framework missing technical details – by the end of 2016, a prospect that seems increasingly unlikely as the United States gears up for elections and anti-trade sentiment continues to rise on both sides of the Atlantic.",

But the European Union has transformed the opt-out into an art form. From the Schengen zone to defense and justice, many countries have treated their EU obligations like an à-la-carte menu from which they can pick and choose at their leisure. But these member states are not entirely to blame; the EU has made a conscious decision to allow its members to adhere to the responsibilities that suit them and ignore those that do not. And while it was a deliberate decision to allow member states to strike a balance between its national and European commitments, the unpredictability it has engendered has weakened the ability of European institutions to act in concert when faced with crises that affect the entire continent. Member states have often fulfilled their EU obligations to the letter, but have selectively made choices that are out of step with the spirit of the EU.",

      "excerpt": "To describe the German economic and social system in a few words, only one term truly captures its essence: “social market economy.” This means a system characterized by a combination of economic dynamism and social justice. The social market economy is based on the freedom of markets and private property, as well as competition among providers of goods and services, all of which are essential to facilitating considerable economic momentum and great material prosperity. The tax and benefit system is set up to distribute economic prosperity among all citizens in the most equitable way possible. Although some question how effective the German economy is at providing social justice, few have questioned the country’s economic performance overall in recent years, particularly when compared to its neighbors. However, in the future, this model may be in danger.",

Typically, presidents hail from one of the country’s traditional Volksparteien, or people’s parties—the center-left Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ) or the center-right Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP). However, amid mounting frustration with the political establishment, voters sent two so-called “outsiders” into a competitive runoff, taking place this weekend. Norbert Hofer, a member of the right-wing Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) famously totes a Glock 26, and has said that refugees are a major threat to Austrian security. His opponent, Green Party veteran Alexander Van der Bellen is running as an independent in this race. He advocates for a strong and cohesive European Union and protecting refugees on humanitarian grounds. Although the role of president is largely ceremonial in Austria, this face-off between two extremes reveals a deepening polarization of the country.",

The arrival of asylum seekers has tested member states’ ability to respond to crises with a united front, a test that they have failed. As a result of the EU’s inability to collectively address the new arrivals, states started unilaterally closing their borders. Even Sweden, which had initially taken in more refugees per capita than any other state, introduced restrictions to its asylum policy and sealed its frontiers. Eventually, Germany was the only state left in the 28-member bloc that kept its borders open. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her government had maintained this position despite fierce criticism from EU neighbors, German politicians and the German people. Why has Germany bucked the European trend, maintaining its open borders and welcoming approach toward refugees?",

A federal indictment followed days later, and the opposition to the Workers' Party (PT) government – both elected officials and regular Joãos in the street—smelled blood.

A combination of its disproportionate economic heft and withering leadership in the rest of the European Union has forced Germany into a position that runs counter to its post-war, consensus-oriented European policy. But with the specter of a Grexit hanging over the Eurozone like the Sword of Damocles, the German government has filled the void in search of a solution.",

      "excerpt": "It is a simple device made of woven bamboo, but the Chinese finger trap has befuddled children for generations. Put an index finger into each end of the cylindrical tube, and there is seemingly no escape. The more force exerted from opposing directions only serves to tighten the grip further. The solution, while counterintuitive, is equally simple. If both sides apply pressure towards the middle, the finger trap mercifully releases its captive digits.Far more complex than extricating oneself from a children’s party favor, the standoff between the West and Russia over Ukraine is well into its second year with combatants once again on the precipice of open conflict. The United States and the European Union have coordinated their approach by imposing sanctions on Russia with the objective of changing President Vladimir Putin’s behavior, but have, thus far, failed to return Ukraine to the status quo ante. Conventional wisdom would suggest that the Europeans should continue to look west and impose more stringent sanctions in concert with the United States. But what if the solution to this particular foreign policy trap lies, instead, in the east?",

So strong was the impact of that year that even today there are lessons to be learned from it. These lessons are all the more important given the recent estrangement between Washington and Berlin that has coincided with the emergence of threats that challenge the West as a whole.",

Last week’s allegations of the CIA’s paying a German informant for documents related to a Bundestag committee’s investigations into the festering NSA scandal unleashed another bout of anger and disbelief in Berlin. This week an investigation of another US mole, this one in the German defense establishment, has been launched. As Berlin’s political leadership sees it, Germany was ― in the aftermath of Edward Snowden’s revelations, which first lifted the veil on widespread American intelligence activities ― shoring up the foundation of the transAtlantic relationship while the US continued to jackhammer it. Washington may want to focus on upcoming mid-term elections and other foreign-policy crises, but US policymakers are being grossly negligent by continuing to ignore German frustration and anger arising from American spying.

Though portrayed as an alcoholic and staunch federalist, Juncker was overwhelmingly elected at the June 26-27 EU summit. The real setback, however, is elsewhere. Cameron’s desperate attempts to block Juncker’s nomination have undermined the prime minister’s valid arguments about the new process of nominating Spitzenkandidaten, or leading candidates, for the Commission presidency. The process, he justifiably claimed, raises concerns about democratic legitimacy, the balance between the European Council and European Parliament, and the ability to select the best candidates. The Council should address these concerns if the Spitzenkandidat process is to continue.",

The meeting’s re-organization is justified in light of the Kremlin’s annexation of Crimea, but it still goes against the group’s founding principles and complicates the West’s relations with Russia.
