let's start to work on the `$COMPONENT`
let's use this post as a guideline for the things we should be aware of. 
`$REF_LINK`

Obviously, we will follow our blueprint for ccm-components.
Let's start with component primer in component-specs/`$COMPONENT`.md

in the component primer add instructions that after implementing the component, you will implement a documentation file in .md format following the component guidelines, and you will implement a demo page, inside the docs/ section, with examples of all the states, variants, etc.
