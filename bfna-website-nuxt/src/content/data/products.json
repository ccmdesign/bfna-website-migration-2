Since joining Bertelsmann Foundation in 2012, his work has focused on economics, politics, the digital revolution, and daily life with a specific emphasis on where these issues intersect. \n  \nHis multimedia approach features documentary film, animated video, and written analysis. Samuel’s documentaries bring viewers up close and personal to people and communities facing the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century, offering candid perspectives that allow viewers to draw their own conclusions. Samuel’s written work has also sought to highlight global crossroads. His publications investigate the global impact of the digital revolution, arguing that a successful digital transition requires an inclusive conversation. This work builds upon previous research that contextualized trends in emerging markets, while underscoring the importance of international economics to the transatlantic community. \n\nSamuel is from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and holds a PhD from Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) in Washington."

    "subheading": "U.S. and German Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic ",
    "description": "<html><head></head><body><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly challenged governments and their leaders around the world. But the crisis may have tested one particular form of government more than any other – federalism. Of the 23 federations around the world today, no two systems are alike. And of these systems, two in particular have had very different pandemic experiences: the United States and Germany. </p>\n<p>In the U.S., competing constitutional interpretations and stark political divisions have undermined most cooperative efforts and hopes of a coordinated nationwide response. Indeed, conflictual, combative, and even dysfunctional best describe American federalism in the COVID-19 era. National, state, and local leaders have repeatedly sparred over appropriate courses of action, jurisdiction, financial support, and the procurement of medical supplies. </p>\n<p>In Germany, relations among federal, state, and local actors have largely remained cooperative and unified – especially during the worst phases of the crisis. Despite periods of slow and disjointed action, federal and state governments have worked together to design and implement a series of nationwide pandemic response measures. The country’s strategy has evolved based on the trajectory of infections, the advice of epidemiological experts, and continued federal-state dialogue, coordination, and cooperation. </p>\n<p>Naturally, these contrasting developments spark the question: Why has federalism in the United States and Germany played out so differently during the COVID-19 pandemic? This publication aims to answer that question by elucidating the key characteristics of both systems and exploring how they have impacted responses to the crisis.   </p>\n<p>Federalism in Crisis is part of the Bertelsmann Foundation’s Newpolitik project, devoted to exploring the most pressing challenges facing the United States and Germany and presenting analysis to policymakers, professors, teachers, and students on both sides of the Atlantic. This edition provides readers with a better understanding of how the U.S. and Germany, through their different forms of federalism, have navigated this once-in-a-century public health crisis.</p></body></html>",

    "og_description": "The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly challenged governments and their leaders around the world. But the crisis may have tested one particular form of government more than any other – federalism. Of the 23 federations around the world today, no two systems are alike. And of these systems, two in particular have had very different pandemic experiences: the United States and Germany. \n\nIn the U.S., competing constitutional interpretations and stark political divisions have undermined most cooperative efforts and hopes of a coordinated nationwide response. Indeed, conflictual, combative, and even dysfunctional best describe American federalism in the COVID-19 era. National, state, and local leaders have repeatedly sparred over appropriate courses of action, jurisdiction, financial support, and the procurement of medical supplies. \n\nIn Germany, relations among federal, state, and local actors have largely remained cooperative and unified – especially during the worst phases of the crisis. Despite periods of slow and disjointed action, federal and state governments have worked together to design and implement a series of nationwide pandemic response measures. The country’s strategy has evolved based on the trajectory of infections, the advice of epidemiological experts, and continued federal-state dialogue, coordination, and cooperation. \n\nNaturally, these contrasting developments spark the question: Why has federalism in the United States and Germany played out so differently during the COVID-19 pandemic? This publication aims to answer that question by elucidating the key characteristics of both systems and exploring how they have impacted responses to the crisis.   \n\nFederalism in Crisis is part of the Bertelsmann Foundation’s Newpolitik project, devoted to exploring the most pressing challenges facing the United States and Germany and presenting analysis to policymakers, professors, teachers, and students on both sides of the Atlantic. This edition provides readers with a better understanding of how the U.S. and Germany, through their different forms of federalism, have navigated this once-in-a-century public health crisis.",

Finally, the reader can find a glossary at the end of the publication of bolded terms found throughout the text and an overview of all featured political parties. \n\nThe combination of primers, political party charts, and citizen surveys about each country showcases where transatlantic policies converge and where there is room for allies to cooperate in 2022.

    "og_description": "We are excited to announce the release of the Fourth Issue of our biannual publication, the Transponder Magazine. The topic of this issue is Identity, featuring a collection of written and visual works that explore the diversity and breadth of identity on both sides of the Atlantic, revealing themes of citizenship, belonging, personhood, heritage, and online persona.\n\nIn an era of widespread digital and cultural transformation, division, and societal change, what makes us who we are? What brings us together and what separates us?  In the following pages, you will find a series of thought-provoking stories and profiles that approach these questions in unique ways, uncovering new dimensions of the intricate tapestry of transatlantic identity.\n\nI hope that these articles inspire deep reflection and new understandings about the multeity of human experience. And, in the process, I hope that you learn something about yourself as well.",

    "subheading": "Bertelsmann Foundation Fellow Class of 2012; Founder and Executive Director of TechCongress",
    "description": "<html><head></head><body><p>*Travis Moore is the Founder and Executive Director of TechCongress, which places computer scientists, engineers, and other technologists to work for Members of Congress and Congressional Committees on key policymaking challenges like AI ethics, election security, encryption, and data privacy through the one-year Congressional Innovation Fellowship. TechCongress has sent 109 technologists into Congress since 2016. *</p>\n<p>*Travis worked on Capitol Hill for six years and was the Legislative Director for Rep. Henry A. Waxman, the former Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. He founded Congress’ first digital communications training program, the institution's first Congressional staff conference, and the Congressional Digital Service Fellowship. Travis is the Co-Founder of #CongressToo, a group of 1500 former Congressional staffers that brought the #MeToo movement to Capitol Hill and spearheaded a reform overhaul signed into law in late 2018. He also serves as a professional development trainer for New Leaders Council. *</p>\n<p><em>These are the personal views of Travis Moore and not those of TechCongress. TechCongress is an independent 501(c)(3) organization that does not advocate or take positions on matters of policy.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Question: What does your day-to-day look like?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Travis:</strong>  We are a technology fellowship for Congress, and our express goal is to be a pipeline for tech expertise on Capitol Hill and the public sector more broadly. It's hard to make a career pivot there. I think there are, and we have certainly seen, lots of folks working in the tech sector that, for a variety of reasons, want to work on problems at scale. People get into the work because they want to tackle problems at scale. Some have felt like the shine has worn off on the tech industry, and some just want to work on bigger problems than they can at a large company, feeling more like a cog in the wheel. They can do that in government. </p>\n<p>Our goal is to find fellows that we think will cover the greatest distance in their fellowship of learning. Often, that means intentionally seeking really smart tech people who may know only a few senators but have a desire, commitment, and motivation to learn.</p>\n<p>We look for individuals who, in a year, can travel a tremendous distance in their learning. We quantify this in the selection process, evaluating how much progress a fellow can make in a year in this program. If someone has worked in the public sector, there's usually much less distance to cover. We aim to be catalytic and think about it in that way.</p>\n<p>The challenge is giving them the right kind of skills, education, and opportunities to apply their skills. My day-to-day involves recruiting, finding, and recruiting the right people. Then there's training and supporting those folks as they head to the public sector. </p>\n<p>Being the founder and executive director involves raising all the money for it. We're relatively small, but it's a couple of million dollars budget. So, there's a lot of being out in the world and telling our story. Then there are grant reports and relaying information to funders. </p>\n<p>We're approaching ten years. We're nine years in, as of last month. Our ten-year anniversary will be in January 2025.</p>\n<p><strong>Question: How do you envision the US federal workforce adapting to the rapid pace of technological change?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Travis:</strong>  I think the executive branch is working really hard on this and is incredibly constrained in the AI executive order, which has a whole title on workforce from the Biden Administration. Agencies are tasked with having Chief AI officers, and there's a campaign for a surge of talent. executive branch is working tirelessly on this, but they face constraints from Congress, as almost no new dollars have been appropriated.</p>\n<p>While the executive branch can authorize certain things around the edges, Congress needs to authorize new programs for many initiatives. In the case of AI, Congress needs to provide additional resources, as agencies are required to have chief AI officers, and top AI engineers in the private sector earn substantial salaries, which the current budget does not account for.</p>\n<p>Congress is discussing this extensively, holding insight forums, but it needs to allocate the necessary resources to support the executive branch internally. There's also a lack of leadership-level conversations about what Congress should do to supplement its own staffing needs and technical capacity. The focus tends to be on the executive branch, but Congress is resource-constrained, leading to potential brain drain issues unless the institution is better resourced for staff, particularly those with technological expertise. I haven't seen enough leadership addressing this concern in Congress.</p>\n<p><strong>Question:  Are you paying attention to what’s coming out of the Europe Union on these issues?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Travis:</strong> I follow it because they are legislating in a way that the United States is not. Europe is certainly taking regulatory steps in a more forward-thinking manner, and they've achieved results. Where Europe faces challenges at a legislative level is similar to Congress; they lack mechanisms and staff with technical backgrounds. I've spoken to numerous MEPs, and they don't have technical staff in the European Parliament either. While Europe benefits from a more formal expert consultation process as part of the policy process, they still lack subject matter knowledge within their staff.</p>\n<p>The analogy I like to use, applicable to both European Parliament members and Congress, is Senator Orrin Hatch asking Mark Zuckerberg about his business model in 2018. It highlights the need for staff with subject matter knowledge sitting behind legislators. While external expert consultants can assist, having knowledgeable staff is crucial because external technical advisers don't directly inform the legislator. About every month or two, I receive emails from someone in Europe interested in our model because, to my knowledge, we are the only ones bringing technical expertise into the policymaking process. It's a model I'd love to see replicated, and we're exploring ways to help socialize it in Europe and elsewhere.</p>\n<p><strong>Question: Have there been forums or exchanges facilitating knowledge transfer specifically regarding technology and the federal workforce that you’ve been paying special attention to?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Travis:</strong> There's a really interesting organization that has just started in the last year and a half called the Integrity Institute. Their role is to work with companies in the integrity category, including trust and safety, content moderation, and individuals on product teams dealing with design implications for privacy or algorithmic bias. They convene these workers, facilitating connections with policymakers on specific issues as they arise. It's a new and intriguing model, being a nonprofit, they raise grant funds, serving as connective tissue between private sector expertise and key roles in policy-making when addressing specific matters.</p>\n<p><strong>Question: Is there anything on your mind as we head into the super charged election year of 2024?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Travis:</strong> When I started TechCongress and moved back a year and a half ago to Washington DC, I attended a conference with diverse startup founders. There was a panel of Y Combinator grads, which is the premier startup accelerator with companies like Airbnb, Dropbox, and Stripe having gone through it.</p>\n<p>A woman on the panel mentioned that between her batch and the one before, there were five different companies focused on solving the problem of outsourcing laundry or dry cleaning. She highlighted that people tend to solve problems they know, and for this class of startup founders, the biggest problem was laundry. This analogy applies to the business community, especially working in Congress, where you face complex problems up front. In Congress, we live these hard, complex problems, some beyond our scope to fix, but some are fixable. </p>\n<p>We need more pathways for people who have experienced Washington's problems to attempt to solve them. People often go into government affairs and lobbying due to inertia and path dependency, following the norm. Personally, I had to start a nonprofit to continue public interest work.</p>\n<p>We need more individuals solving problems and thinking about the infrastructure required in Washington to help people address the problems they know. It's challenging to be a problem solver after leaving Congress when the incentives push towards making more money and compensating for the time spent earning less. The incentives in Washington often steer away from the public interest at a time when we desperately need more creative problem solving. </p>\n<p>In the technology sector there are whole categories of infrastructure to help founders launch and scale organizations and solve problems. Venture capital, crowdfunding, accelerators, incubators, and lean startup methodology provide structure and support to startups. I 100% would not have been able launch and grow TechCongress absent the two accelerators I participated in. And I was only able to join these programs because I was living in San Francisco, where startups go through these programs as a default. We’ve got to find ways to a similar or parallel infrastructure in Washington to make it easier to solve problems in the public sector. </p></body></html>",

Whether negotiating in the desert of Darfur or in the markets of the Middle East, the lessons learned along the way are crucial for those seeking peace and stability in a volatile world.\n\nIn this third season, Leadership in Action reveals the approaches of skilled negotiators and practitioners, as they attempt to solve some of the world’s most intractable challenges. In the months ahead, we will release new episodes featuring Ugandan opposition leader Bobi Wine, who takes us on a harrowing journey from repression in the streets of Kampala, to mobilizing an entire nation in the fight for democracy.  We’ll also take you to the flashpoint of the Israel-Palestinian conflict with former Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, in search of a way forward. \n\nLeadership in Action is part of an ongoing collaboration between the Bertelsmann Foundation and the Aspen Institute’s Aspen Ministers Forum.",

    "og_description": "Paul Sparrow, former Director of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum, speaks with Andrew Keen about the immense challenges and legacies of FDR and his administration. Sparrow maintains that Roosevelt saved American democracy from an existential crisis caused by the Great Depression and the failure of previous administrations to provide for the welfare of the public. In this episode of How to Fix Democracy, Sparrow delves into the deep complexities of the 32nd U.S. President who employed the powerful resources of his mind and personality.\n\nPaul Sparrow is a writer, historical consultant, and the former Director of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum. Before moving to the FDR Library, he was the Deputy Director and Senior Vice President for Broadcasting and New Media at the Newseum in Washington, D.C. He was a founding partner in the University of Maryland’s Future of Information Alliance and a pioneer in interactive digital media. Prior to his work at the Newseum, Sparrow was an Emmy-Award winning television producer, and showrunner for Discovery, TLC, Fox, and PBS.

Both provincially insular and dynamically modern, Hochschild introduces us to an America nostalgic for an idyllic pre-war normalcy that can never be recaptured. </p>\n<p>How to Fix Democracy Season 5 covers 100 years of American democracy between 1924 and 2024. The season uncovers the complexities of U.S. history and asks our distinguished guests why it remains the most iconic and yet misunderstood democratic system in the world.

    "og_description": "American Democracy in the Aftermath of World War I | In the first episode of Season 5, How to Fix Democracy host Andrew Keen sits down with Adam Hochschild, historian, journalist, and award-winning author of “American Midnight: The Great War, a Violent Peace, and Democracy's Forgotten Crisis.\" Hochschild takes us on a journey to America in the aftermath of World War I – a country divided by labor strife, xenophobic fear of immigrants, and massive violations of civil rights. Both provincially insular and dynamically modern, Hochschild introduces us to an America nostalgic for an idyllic pre-war normalcy that can never be recaptured. \n\nHow to Fix Democracy Season 5 covers 100 years of American democracy between 1924 and 2024. The season uncovers the complexities of U.S. history and asks our distinguished guests why it remains the most iconic and yet misunderstood democratic system in the world. This season is brought to you by the Bertelsmann Foundation and Humanity in Action. Listen wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nYou can also listen on [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/how-to-fix-democracy/id1451517552), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZyoFf6KO8AqmA2GEy12ZP), [Deezer](https://deezer.page.link/iF4U8Z6cSDP132LN6), and more.",

Then Brandon Bohrn, project manager at the [Bertelsmann Stiftung](https://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/en/home/), and Gesine Weber, research analyst at the [German Marshall Fund](https://www.gmfus.org/) of the United States discuss the results of the [Transatlantic Trends 2022](https://www.bfna.org/politics-society/transatlantic-trends-2022/)  survey and report and share their personal thoughts on the transatlantic relationship.\n\n<iframe height=\"200px\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless src=https://player.simplecast.com/0992d250-0906-45cd-825b-32b8b252bb6e?dark=true></iframe>\n\nYou can also listen on [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/transatlantic-generational-divide/id1605180676?i=1000590764248), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7IYfsYoNdxE6eFhQvNs69X), [Deezer](https://deezer.page.link/3eeGzPHySVLvHrUA6), and [Stitcher](https://www.stitcher.com/show/bridging-the-atlantic/episode/transatlantic-generational-divide-210046845).\n",

Since the overturning of Roe v.

From Yan Shi’s gift to King Mu in the 10th century to Jane Robinson’s advancements in natural language processing in the late 20th century, the theoretical and practical applications of AI has opened a new frontier in scientific discovery. In some ways, this technology has surpassed human ability in specific tests. OpenAI's GPT-3 is an example of a machine that can create language that is almost indiscernible from our own. This leads to one of my definitions of AI; a machine that, for specific tasks, can rapidly achieve tasks at a similar or higher level than humans. As Andrew Ng simply said, AI is the new electricity.\n\n__How can we envision or describe data in a sentence or two?__ \nI see data as the rapid analysis of isolated information points in order to reach an actionable conclusion or to explain phenomena. Data will be one of the highest valued commodities as AI continues to progress. \n\n__Are you optimistic or pessimistic about the effects of AI on society? Why?__\nI’m optimistic about the diseases, food shortage, and climate change issues AI has the ability to address. I’m pessimistic about whether government will prioritize data privacy policy to protect citizens from wrongly used metadata, whether AI will be able to regulate negative biases in implementation, and the effects AI will have on our workforce of strategic changes in education and training aren’t made. \n\n__What’s your favorite quarantine song?__\nRecently, Georgia on My Mind-- Ray Charles\n\n__What’s your go-to quarantine drink?__\nCoffee with a shot of espresso and cream.

Why?__\nBetween utopia and dystopia, many more scenarios are possible. At stake is nothing less than what kind of society we aim to live in and how we experience humanity in the 21st century.\n\nI am optimistic we will use AI to improve the state of the world. On the one hand, we can use AI to further reduce global poverty as well as diseases and offer better education to almost every student on our planet. On the other hand, AI and machine learning can also be used to increasingly concentrate power, wealth and leaving many people worse off. It is our mission to ensure the technology advancement matches our values. I am convinced that AI will, above all, strengthen and improve the effectiveness of human activities – but will not replace them. The economic potential of AI is huge - but we also have to lift it.\n\n__What’s your go-to quarantine drink?__\nDouble Espresso Macchiato.\n\n__What’s a startup that you think is really cool right now?__\n[Lilium](https://lilium.com/), the Munich-based startup making one of the world’s first all-electric vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) jets.\n"

Artifictional intelligence: Against humanity's surrender to computers..\nHannah Fry (2019) Hello world: How to be human in the age of the machine.\n\n__How do you define AI in a few sentences?__\nI’d say it’s machines that can respond autonomously to their environment in a way that we consider intelligent. One of the problems with the field is this loose and subjective definition which I think has become an obstacle to productive and meaningful debate. \n\n__Are you optimistic or pessimistic about the effects of AI on society? Why?__\nI’m a bit of tech-pessimist in general. For AI, I find it hard to imagine that AI will contribute to the reversal of equating structural inequalities. I think if anything it is more likely to exacerbate them. I think AI (and tech more generally) is seen too much as an end in itself, while the benefits it has delivered so far are much more frivolous than the promises. I think seeing AI as a means to deliver real social value rather than as an end in itself could help improve matters. \n\n__What’s the most pressing policy we need to change or develop surrounding AI?__\nI think we need to address the market ecosystem, which tends too easily towards domination. I’m worried about how communicating with others and participating in public debates now seems to require joining private platforms (i.e. facebook and twitter). On a related note, im worried that AI will close down people’s margins of manoeuvre as more aspects of our lives are measured and used as data. \n\n__What is the most difficult part of working at the intersection of technology and policy?__\nProbably the speed of technology development, and the hype that can surround some technologies.\n\n__What’s one thing people might not know about you?__\nAh but if I tell then people would know it!\n"

His educational training focused on political science and sociology.\n\nStefan bemoans “digitization” as a buzzword and is interested in artificial intelligence and the digital world from a philosophical and policy perspective. In his free time, he is a tech blogger and podcaster on [his website](http://stefan-krabbes.de/), where he covers politics, digital issues, and culture. \n\n__How do you define AI in a few sentences?__ \nIf one says industrialization was the outsourcing of physical works from human beings to machines, digitization is the outsourcing of mental works from human beings to machines. Focusing on the part of digitization artificial intelligence is more the creative and smart solving of problems (at least finding possible solutions) by “machines”. But for sure, there is a difference between machine learning and ai. Via machine learning you can program a robot to let it climb the stairs and it improves the climbing step by step. Via ai you can ask the robot to bring you the glass of milk from the kitchen and it completely knows what to do. That’s my definition, even if it's more a description.\n\n__How can we envision or describe data in a sentence or two?__\nData is fixing points of our lives. Based on a German movie about Alexander von Humboldt, I’d say that digitization is the new measuring of our world by using these fixing points. But there’s a saying data is the new oil. This saying may work from the perspective of earning money, but there is a difference: data’s unlimited.\n\n__What is the most difficult part of working at the intersection of technology and policy?__\nThe basic work and basic understanding. Digitization is used as a buzzword, currently - especially in political circles, when one tries to be hip and tech-affin.

There may be data as an input for training e.g. for model based AIs but not necessarily if we think of policy driven reinforcement learning.\n\n__How can we envision or describe data in a sentence or two?__\nData can be numeric, characteristic or symbolic values that describe facts or statistics. It is used to describe or define events as an input for human or machine understanding, yet, neither machines nor humans need (past) data as input necessarily.\n\n__What’s the most pressing policy we need to change or develop surrounding AI?__\nIn my view it is the question about data sovereignty and privacy. There is a lot of industry pressure that wants to gain massive access to user data for free. However, the data belongs fundamentally to the users and not to any company. It is also simply not true that companies require access to this data to deliver great services. We have technical possibilities to deliver the same services and convenience whilst guaranteeing the highest possible data privacy protection. And if a company really wants to have the data of users in plain text they should pay for it. Delivering convenience or a specific service is just not enough.    \n\n__What is the most difficult part of working at the intersection of technology and policy?__\nThe complexity of merging law and technology is always challenging due to the pace of technical development and the slowness (not in bad meaning) of policy.\n\n__What’s your favorite book?__\n[Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies](https://www.bookdepository.com/Superintelligence-Nick-Bostrom/9780199678112) by Nick Bostrom.\n"

Why?__ \nThe use of AI has a great potential. It is an essential means to shape the way we want to live in the future. It promises the optimization of processes, fast decision-making but could also involve a loss of control and an ethical debate of the technology in order to generate the trust of the users or customers. The more powerful an AI-System, the greater the responsibility of the user. There can be disagreement over when and where exactly AI begins and where it’s natural or technological (i.e. scientific) limits are. Ethical standards are very important for an optimistic future of AI, so that the user can engage in innovation and that one has not to fear disadvantages, non-transparency or data misuse. There are chances and risks, which are not balanced, but in my opinion the chances are greater. Important to me from the outset is the bottom line that AI has to always serve human kind.\n\n__What’s the most pressing policy we need to change or develop surrounding AI?__\nDigital change and AI have to go side by side.

Why?__\nIt can be used to both ends and I don’t think fundamentally rejecting or embracing helps us making the best of AI; I prefer thoroughly understanding the system, making use of the good and exposing the bad. For this, we need educated societies that have debates about pending value judgements. Rather than yet another panel talk on the trolley problem of autonomous driving, we need to answer questions of how we can we foster innovation, improve living standards and reduce inequality. \n\n__What’s the most pressing policy we need to change or develop surrounding AI?__\nMake AI more diverse and create spaces to develop ideas on how to tackle climate change and reduce social inequality.\n\n__What’s your favorite book?__\nI recently read [Humankind: A Hopeful History](https://www.littlebrown.com/titles/rutger-bregman/humankind/9780316418553/) by Rutger Bregman, which I quite enjoyed because, like all the books that leave a lasting impression with me, it gives plenty opportunities to discuss new thoughts with people around me. \n\n__What’s your favorite quarantine song?__ \n[Line of Fire – Junip.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL6inz4WPhQ) \n"

    "description": "<html><head></head><body><p><em>Graphic Images</em> is the third volume in the Disrupting Democracy series. </p>\n<p>Disrupting Democracy focuses on technology’s impact on political, economic, and social ecosystems worldwide. In the first volume, we examined how technological innovations transformed countries at various stages of political and technological development. Our case studies – India, Germany, Israel, Cuba, and the United States – demonstrated distinct experiences at the intersection of technology and democracy, but there were common themes that cut across all the countries. Bridging the urban-rural access divide, combatting disinformation, and displacing traditional media presented policy challenges that each government had to face.</p>\n<p>In Disrupting Democracy Volume II, we probed more deeply in our research by conducting our work within the crucible of active election campaigns. Those pages tell the tales of the Democratic Party’s “blue wave” in the US midterm elections, history-making victories for populism in Mexico and Italy, and Russia’s ongoing attempts to influence electoral outcomes in neighboring Latvia. These cases revealed an unbalanced ledger of benefits and consequences of technology on campaigning, elections systems, and governance.</p>\n<p>For this third edition of the series, we decided to turn everything you’ve come to expect from Disrupting Democracy on its head. Rather than looking at the impact of technology on democracy, this volume will use technology to help us better explain democracy in the 21st century. Through the use of carefully constructed algorithms by our partners at the Institute for Competitiveness, we have collected data points that are the driving forces behind the volatility in democracy today. We’ve taken more than 10,000 data points and converted them into a compendium of visualizations that provides a degree of depth that will take you well beyond any written analysis.    </p></body></html>",

    "og_description": "*Graphic Images* is the third volume in the Disrupting Democracy series. \n\nDisrupting Democracy focuses on technology’s impact on political, economic, and social ecosystems worldwide. In the first volume, we examined how technological innovations transformed countries at various stages of political and technological development. Our case studies – India, Germany, Israel, Cuba, and the United States – demonstrated distinct experiences at the intersection of technology and democracy, but there were common themes that cut across all the countries. Bridging the urban-rural access divide, combatting disinformation, and displacing traditional media presented policy challenges that each government had to face.\n\nIn Disrupting Democracy Volume II, we probed more deeply in our research by conducting our work within the crucible of active election campaigns. Those pages tell the tales of the Democratic Party’s “blue wave” in the US midterm elections, history-making victories for populism in Mexico and Italy, and Russia’s ongoing attempts to influence electoral outcomes in neighboring Latvia. These cases revealed an unbalanced ledger of benefits and consequences of technology on campaigning, elections systems, and governance.\n\nFor this third edition of the series, we decided to turn everything you’ve come to expect from Disrupting Democracy on its head. Rather than looking at the impact of technology on democracy, this volume will use technology to help us better explain democracy in the 21st century. Through the use of carefully constructed algorithms by our partners at the Institute for Competitiveness, we have collected data points that are the driving forces behind the volatility in democracy today. We’ve taken more than 10,000 data points and converted them into a compendium of visualizations that provides a degree of depth that will take you well beyond any written analysis.    \n",

          "bio": "Tony Silberfeld joined the Bertelsmann Foundation as the Director of Transatlantic Relations in April 2014, overseeing a project portfolio aimed at strengthening the Euro-Atlantic alliance through traditional and innovative means. His research focuses on democratic innovations in cities, and geopolitical competition in space. He currently oversees two online platforms, RANGE and the Transatlantic Periscope, that provide geopolitical forecasting capacity and in-depth analyses of America’s bilateral relationships with its European partners, respectively. Tony has produced long-form publications, policy briefs, graphic books, education guides, digital animations and feature-length documentary films, constantly exploring cutting-edge avenues to connect the Foundation’s work to policymakers and the public.\n\nTony arrived at the Foundation after seven years with the United Kingdom’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office, where he was head of political and public affairs at the British Embassy’s Northern Ireland Bureau in Washington, DC. He also served as the Northern Ireland government spokesman in the Americas, and advised government ministers on political developments in the United States, Canada and Brazil. Prior to his tenure with the British government, Tony held posts as a foreign policy advisor in the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives.\n\nTony has a master’s degree from the University of Denver’s Josef Korbel School of International Studies and a bachelor’s degree from Tulane University."
