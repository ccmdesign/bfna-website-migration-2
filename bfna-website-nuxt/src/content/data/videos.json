To date, we've shared the story of Russian disinformation in Georgia and Iran's use of proxy militias in Iraq and beyond.  Today, we'll offer you a case study in Chinese economic coercion through the lens of the THAAD episode in South Korea.</p>\n<p>In 2017, the South Korean government agreed to host the U.S. missile defense system, known as THAAD, in response to threats made and tests conducted by North Korea.  Beijing viewed this weapons system as a threat to its interests and objected to its placement just outside of Seoul.

Conspiracy theories about local, state, and federal governments coming to “take your guns” or control local populations in other ways play a role in the appeal of the boogaloo scene. Anti-government extremism in the US was already increasing before COVID-19, but the pandemic has accelerated the circulation of anti-government conspiracy theories, disinformation and propaganda. There is an urgent need to develop a better understanding of online radicalization, and to create new avenues to connect with those at risk. \n\n![Henry Graves at his computer](//images.ctfassets.net/9vgcz0fppkl3/1SPzUpLx676vY70fyrkQlZ/b61b575248e552088785031d396ccefd/vlcsnap-2020-09-22-13h59m03s749.png)\n\nWith that in mind, the Bertelsmann Foundation and [American University’s Polarization and Extremism Research and Innovation Lab (PERIL)](https://www.american.edu/centers/university-excellence/peril.cfm) bring you this animated short to tell this important story through the eyes of our eponymous Henry Graves. This animation is part of the Foundation’s Disrupting Democracy project, and serves as a companion piece to our upcoming feature length documentary Uncivil War.\n\nThis animation is part of the Bertelsmann Foundation’s [collection of educational videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL36lfVkdVQqkfgG4Qn0DeVm3OD3xrfJrS) focused on critical issues in the United States and the European Union.\n\nTo accompany this animation, we have created an education guide for use in secondary schools and university courses. Educators can use this to guide discussion and spark debate after viewing the video.

And yet, Villa 31 remains so far. Despite a long history dating back nearly a century, land rights remain informal. Access to basic utilities like water and electricity can be spotty and is often jerry-rigged by residents living off of the formal Buenos Aires grid.</p>\n<p>Villa 31 is precisely the kind of neighborhood most at risk by the digital transformation. While geographically it may be minutes’ walk from the country’s financial heart, it could become increasingly disconnected, with a digital gulf far greater than the physical distance.</p>\n<p>In this new animation, we follow local leaders as they push to have Villa 31 included on Google maps. On the one hand, this would give the neighborhood access to city services. On the other hand, in the 21st century, a digital presence may prove as important as physical presence. As major breakthroughs continue to occur in online technology, those that remain offline will be left further and further behind.</p>\n<p>This animation is part of the Bertelsmann Foundation’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL36lfVkdVQqlMpF2-ZzhluO28KpILH8BQ\">Our Digital World</a> animation series.</p></body></html>",

      "og_description": "Villa 31 is so close. Perhaps Argentina’s most notorious informal barrio, Villa 31 spills out over downtown Buenos Aires’ historic train station. And yet, Villa 31 remains so far. Despite a long history dating back nearly a century, land rights remain informal. Access to basic utilities like water and electricity can be spotty and is often jerry-rigged by residents living off of the formal Buenos Aires grid.\n\nVilla 31 is precisely the kind of neighborhood most at risk by the digital transformation. While geographically it may be minutes’ walk from the country’s financial heart, it could become increasingly disconnected, with a digital gulf far greater than the physical distance.\n\nIn this new animation, we follow local leaders as they push to have Villa 31 included on Google maps. On the one hand, this would give the neighborhood access to city services. On the other hand, in the 21st century, a digital presence may prove as important as physical presence. As major breakthroughs continue to occur in online technology, those that remain offline will be left further and further behind.\n\nThis animation is part of the Bertelsmann Foundation’s [Our Digital World](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL36lfVkdVQqlMpF2-ZzhluO28KpILH8BQ) animation series.",

With many of its member states dependent on Russian fossil fuels, the situation created a crisis with the potential to undermine EU solidarity. What was done at the EU-level to combat the energy crisis this winter? And how did national governments take action to keep their citizens warm and the political climate cool? This animation examines policy responses from the EU, Estonia, Germany, and Greece, all of which took different approaches to easing their energy constraints. </p>\n<p>To learn more about energy within the transatlantic sphere, visit the Transatlantic Barometer, an interactive multimedia site that provides quick facts, visual representations, and reliable information on the U.S., UK, EU, and its member states regarding pressing transatlantic challenges.

      "og_description": "In February 2022, the Russian invasion of Ukraine sparked not only a threat to democracy worldwide, but also an unprecedented energy challenge for the European Union. With many of its member states dependent on Russian fossil fuels, the situation created a crisis with the potential to undermine EU solidarity. What was done at the EU-level to combat the energy crisis this winter? And how did national governments take action to keep their citizens warm and the political climate cool? This animation examines policy responses from the EU, Estonia, Germany, and Greece, all of which took different approaches to easing their energy constraints. \n\nTo learn more about energy within the transatlantic sphere, visit the Transatlantic Barometer, an interactive multimedia site that provides quick facts, visual representations, and reliable information on the U.S., UK, EU, and its member states regarding pressing transatlantic challenges.

While trade and security have been the traditional cornerstones, the people-to-people connections are really the heart of the relationship. How have these connections come to be? It all starts with exchange - especially at a young age. \n\nIn our latest animation, we follow the story of Kent Logsdon, a career U.S. diplomat and former chargé d'affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin, who gained his first international experience through a German-American exchange program in high school. \n\nThis animation is part of the [Wunderbar Together 2020](https://www.wunderbar2gether.org/home) initiative that aims to promote the importance of robust German-American relations.

Conspiracy theories about local, state, and federal governments coming to “take your guns” or control local populations in other ways play a role in the appeal of the boogaloo scene. Anti-government extremism in the US was already increasing before COVID-19, but the pandemic has accelerated the circulation of anti-government conspiracy theories, disinformation and propaganda. There is an urgent need to develop a better understanding of online radicalization, and to create new avenues to connect with those at risk. \n\n![Henry Graves at his computer](//images.ctfassets.net/9vgcz0fppkl3/1SPzUpLx676vY70fyrkQlZ/b61b575248e552088785031d396ccefd/vlcsnap-2020-09-22-13h59m03s749.png)\n\nWith that in mind, the Bertelsmann Foundation and [American University’s Polarization and Extremism Research and Innovation Lab (PERIL)](https://www.american.edu/centers/university-excellence/peril.cfm) bring you this animated short to tell this important story through the eyes of our eponymous Henry Graves. This animation is part of the Foundation’s Disrupting Democracy project, and serves as a companion piece to our upcoming feature length documentary Uncivil War.\n\nThis animation is part of the Bertelsmann Foundation’s [collection of educational videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL36lfVkdVQqkfgG4Qn0DeVm3OD3xrfJrS) focused on critical issues in the United States and the European Union.\n\nTo accompany this animation, we have created an education guide for use in secondary schools and university courses. Educators can use this to guide discussion and spark debate after viewing the video.
