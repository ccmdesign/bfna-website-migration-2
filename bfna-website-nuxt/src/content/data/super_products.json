First, European elections will bring changes to the European Parliament and European Commission, and then all eyes will be on the US presidential election. I speak with experts on what to expect in the near future for the transatlantic relationship.",

Millennials and Gen Z already exert their political influence through voting—and in some cases as legislators or even heads of government—but for the most part the transatlantic political agenda is set by older generations.",

A summer of wildfires and droughts from the west coast of the United States to southern Spain kept the impact of climate change in the transatlantic headlines. Yet somehow, it seemed like there were always more salient political issues stealing attention away from climate action.",

As the response to the war in Ukraine has shown, NATO and the EU work well together when the need arises, but questions remain about how to enhance EU security while strengthening NATO.",

Over time, the divide narrowed, but more importantly, policy approaches became more sophisticated. Our guests explain how, in the case of platform regulation, the United States and the European Union have converged despite different perspectives.",
