This can only be achieved through international exchange, idea-sharing, and learning from prior successes and failures of transatlantic leadership. Through research, polling, and our transatlantic legislative exchange program, the Bertelsmann Foundation Fellowship (BFF), we seek to foster stronger transatlantic ties through a deeper mutual understanding.",

Commencing with an in-person trip to Washington, D.C., fellows then embark on a three-month virtual program, meeting weekly with experts relevant to the year's theme. The fellowship culminates with a visit to Brussels facilitating further in-person engagement. At the program's conclusion, fellows collaborate on a final publication presenting concrete policy recommendations pertaining to the chosen topic, released as an outcome of the BFF initiative.
