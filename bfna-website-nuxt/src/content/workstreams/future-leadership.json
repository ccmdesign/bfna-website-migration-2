  "description": "Leaders around the world have been forced to grapple with a series of unfamiliar threats to domestic and international stability. From the COVID-19 pandemic to right-wing populism and escalating state-sponsored and rogue cyberattacks, the need for effective leadership at this moment is critical. This can only be achieved through international exchange, idea-sharing, and learning from prior successes and failures of transatlantic leadership. Through research, polling, and our transatlantic legislative exchange program, the Bertelsmann Foundation Fellowship (BFF), we seek to foster stronger transatlantic ties through a deeper mutual understanding.",

      "excerpt": "The Bertelsmann Foundation Fellowship (BFF), formerly known as the Congressional European Parliamentary Initiative (CEPI), offers a unique transatlantic hybrid experience spanning five months, designed to foster connections, knowledge transfer, and learning. Each year, the fellowship delves into global challenges confronting the transatlantic alliance. Commencing with an in-person trip to Washington, D.C., fellows then embark on a three-month virtual program, meeting weekly with experts relevant to the year's theme. The fellowship culminates with a visit to Brussels facilitating further in-person engagement. At the program's conclusion, fellows collaborate on a final publication presenting concrete policy recommendations pertaining to the chosen topic, released as an outcome of the BFF initiative. Fellows then also become a part of a larger, active Alumni network- finding opportunities to engage with the Bertelsmann Foundation Fellowship beyond their fellowship year.",
