  "description": "Democratic decline in the U.S. and Europe is weakening the transatlantic relationship and undermining its influence around the world. America and its European allies need to recalibrate their values and practices at home in order to serve as beacons to aspiring democracies abroad. But disruptions to our democratic traditions keep emerging: from new technologies changing the way we communicate and work to pandemics and economic shocks. Our work analyzes how these disruptions are playing out, and it will be up to civil society, lawmakers, and the people to prepare our democracies for the future.",

And while democracy has always faced external threats, a second front has emerged in recent years, challenging its fundamental principles from within. On every continent, local and national governments are experimenting with new methods of tackling the threats to public confidence and democratic governance by addressing a range of common challenges. The drivers of democratic backsliding are now clear, so this project focuses on uncovering solutions, then amplifies these best practices for a transatlantic audience searching for innovative approaches to reverse democratic decline.",
