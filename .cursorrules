# CRITICAL: Never Edit node_modules

**ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**: Under NO circumstances should you EVER edit, modify, or create files in the `node_modules/` directory or any subdirectory within it.

**Why this is critical**:
- Files in `node_modules/` are managed by package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm)
- Any changes will be overwritten on the next `npm install` or package update
- Editing dependencies directly breaks the dependency management system
- This is a fundamental violation of proper software development practices

**What to do instead**:
- If you need to modify a dependency's behavior, create a wrapper, patch, or fork the package properly
- Use package.json patches, patch-package, or fork the package and reference your fork
- If you encounter issues with a dependency, report it upstream or find an alternative solution
- Never suggest editing files in `node_modules/` as a solution

**Enforcement**:
- If you see a file path containing `node_modules/`, immediately reject the operation
- If a user requests editing something in `node_modules/`, explain why this is not allowed and suggest proper alternatives
- This rule applies to ALL operations: reading, writing, editing, deleting, or creating files
